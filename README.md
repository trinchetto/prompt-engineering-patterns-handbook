# Prompt Engineering Patterns Handbook

## Introduction

Prompt engineering is the art of crafting clear, purposeful instructions for large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT.
Done well, it’s less “asking nicely” and more **architecting conversations** so the AI delivers exactly what you need — consistently.

The patterns here are **reusable blueprints**. Each is like a Lego brick: snap them together to build anything from a polite email rewriter to a fully automated AI agent workflow.

### Overview

The Prompt Engineering Patterns Handbook is a Markdown-based guide that catalogues reusable prompt-design blueprints for large language models. The repository includes a project overview `README.md` and a `docs/` directory with four themed pattern files (`docs/interaction-patterns.md`, `docs/structuring-patterns.md`, `docs/reasoning-patterns.md`, and `docs/creativity-patterns.md`) alongside contributing guidelines.

### Architecture & Concepts

- **Master index** – `docs/README.md` lists every pattern, grouped into four categories: Interaction, Structuring, Reasoning & Analysis, and Creativity & Exploration.
- **Pattern files** – Each category file in `docs/` documents specific patterns using a consistent template: description, purpose, problem solved, data needed, a “quick copy-paste prompt,” and general vs. AI-agent examples.
- **Custom GPTs** – `gpts/` contains ready-to-use GPT configurations that apply these patterns in practice.
- **Contribution workflow** – `CONTRIBUTING.md` outlines how to add a new pattern: choose the correct group file, follow the standard section format, and update the docs catalog.

### Pointers for Further Exploration

1. **Dive into pattern groups**: Start with the docs’ “Detailed Guides” links to explore each category in depth.
2. **Practice with examples**: Try out the “Quick Copy-Paste Prompt” snippets in the pattern files to see how they influence model responses.
3. **Contribute new patterns**: Follow the contributing guidelines to add or refine patterns, keeping examples and prompts concise.
4. **Experiment with chaining patterns**: Combine multiple patterns (e.g., Persona + Template) to build richer, more controllable prompt workflows.
